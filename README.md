# iDE
IDE for iPadOS <br />

<br />

## Project Goal

The project aims to build an integrated development environment (IDE) for multiple languages on an iPad with an M1 chip or higher, and is currently a very experimental project. That's why the project can always be disrupted.

Almost all languages have not been released for iPadOS, and there are many limitations to running native on iPadOS. To address this issue, the iDE project hosts Alpine Linux with a QEMU-based arm64 emulator, and all languages are built and run on the hosted Linux.

In short, it is a project that makes the iPad available as a development machine.

<br />

## First goal. Primary supported language (or framework / runtime engine)

The list below is the language officially supported by the iDE project to be first goal.

When the first goal is completed, other languages will be implemented.

## First goal. Editor

## If you're interested in a project...

The project is a individual-side project, but it is a large-scale project for individuals. If you are interested at any time, please feel free to contact me via email. Also, I hope there are improvements I would appreciate it if you could register the feature as Issue.
